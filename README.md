# PySignalProcessing
This is just a personal project for implementing some of the signal processing concepts in python.

This is useful for:
- Beginners: so that they can get a grasp on some of the basic theories of signal processing. Play around with variables, see the effects of certain changes and get a solid foundation.
- Experts: who are either transitioning from Matlab into Python or simply for people who needs a recap in the basics.

This is not a single "project" per se. Each number coded python file is executable and will either plot or display some output.
